# Zanshin

Zanshin means 'relaxed alertness', or when literally translated, 'the mind with no remainder'. The goal of this project is to test and document how machine learning can be used to analyze Judo techniques and effictiveness from both prerecorded footage and live video feeds.

This project builds on top of the work done at [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com), specifically with the `yolov8` pose detection model.
